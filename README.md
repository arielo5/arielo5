Never satisfied with being on the sidelines of technological advancement, I became a Full Stack Web Developer with a background in engineering, using my knowledge to build a more intuitive user experience on the web. Iâ€™ve recently earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp, with newly developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, React.js and responsive web design. My friends, coworkers, and family members know me as an innovative problem solver, passionate about developing apps, with a current focus on mobile-first design and development. With each project, my aim is to best engage my audience for an impactful user experience. I applied aspects of UX and agile development in a recent project, working with a team of four to develop a single-page MERN app that helps everyone that joins the site to create any poll and track the top choices. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my skills as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build better experiences on the web.
